Describing your Code in an Interview
______________________________________

Some techniques for realizing during the interview:

Pretend you already have the job and the interviewer is a coworker who came to you for help on a difficult problem.

* If you already had the job, there's no stress
* Reframes the situation from an interview to just problem-solving
* Puts you in cooperative mindset
* It forces you to teach the problem and solution

UPER is the key to it all
______________________________________

Understand
* Ask questions about the problem
* Have a dialog with the interviewer 
* Put the problem in your own words to make sure that you understand what is being asked
* Think of similar questions that you've already solved
 
Plan
* Come up with multiple plans, if possible
* Don't ignore the naive plans
* Teach the plan to the interviewer
* Think in big concepts


Execute
* If you're describing your existing code:
    * The interviewer is going to be looking for places where the concepts match up with your code
    * The better you explain your code the easier time the interviewer will have understanding
    * Either have easy to understand code or do a code job explaining your process to the interviewer
    * Try to do both
    * Point out interesting things in it

* If you're writing new code:
    * THe interviewer will still look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
    * Actually code it up at this point

Reflect
* What could we have done better?
* Future directions and features
* If you made any mistakes, point them out with solutions.
