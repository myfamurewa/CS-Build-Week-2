"Have you ever made a mistake, How did you deal with it?"

I make mistakes all the time. The most recent mistake that I made was when I was working as a Team Lead. I mistakenly gave a student too much of an extension on their sprint. 
I dealt with it by making the student aware that they had been given too much extra time but also honoring the extension that I had had given. When I make mistakes I try to own up to them
learn from them and move on with the knowledge that I won't make the same mistake again. You learn a lot more from messing up than you do from succeeding immediately every time. The key is to not give
in and to remain persistent. You will get it eventually.
